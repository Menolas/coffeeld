## Description

This is template for practice. Here I employed adaptive and fluid layout techniques.

The original design encompassed three resolutions (mobile, tablet and desktop), with four breakpoints envisaged by me:

* 320px
* 768px
* 992px
* 1280px

Main technologies employed: SCSS as CSS preprocessor and Gulp as project build tool. See package.json for the list of plugins/dependencies and gulpfile.js for details of my workflow.

## How to deploy

1. Clone the project from Github.
2. Install all required dependencies via NPM (run npm install in your terminal while in the project root directory). Note: you also need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.
3. Run "start" command in the terminal window.
